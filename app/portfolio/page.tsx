      title: 'GSR Wristband',
      description: 'During my internship at the Neuromechanics and Assistive Robotics Lab at the University of Waterloo, I conducted GSR (galvanic skin response) signal processing and analysis to study stress responses and evaluate exoskeleton controller performance. Using a wrist-worn device with GSR electrodes and an IMU, I designed an experiment where participants watched stress-inducing videos, pre-labeled for stress events, while GSR data was recorded. I applied the CVXEDA algorithm to separate tonic and phasic components from raw signals, enabling the identification of stress peaks hidden in slow-changing trends. I developed and tested machine learning models(KNN and Naive Bayes) to classify three- second GSR windows as stressed or non - stressed, achieving reliable classification accuracy for binary stress states.For the second phase, I designed treadmill experiments to evaluate the correlation between GSR signals and exoskeleton controller performance under three conditions: time - based, gait - phase - based, and adaptive feedforward control.I segmented multimodal data‚Äîincluding GSR, IMU, ground reaction forces, and EMG‚Äîand extracted key metrics like peak frequency, mean phasic response, and variance. Statistical tests revealed no significant differences in stress metrics between controllers(e.g., Friedman test: (ùëù = 0.0871), but trends suggested potential correlations between stress and user preferences(ùúè = 0.299, ùëù = 0.132).I streamlined data workflows, performed visualizations with Matplotlib, and provided detailed insights into controller performance and stress - response dynamics.This project showcased my ability to design experiments, analyze complex datasets, and develop data - driven solutions for human - centered robotics.',
